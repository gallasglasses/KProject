### I. Description of the game world

The world of Kalevala is a mythical and magical place inhabited by gods, heroes, witches and other supernatural beings and where the forces of good and evil are constantly at war.
The landscape of Kalevala is vast and varied, including forests, lakes, rivers, mountains and the sea. It is a world shaped by the forces of nature, where the spirits of the natural world are seen as powerful and sometimes dangerous beings. The characters in Kalevala are closely connected to the earth and the natural elements and often use their knowledge of the natural world to overcome difficulties and solve problems.
The world of Kalevala is also a place of great conflict, where the forces of good and evil are constantly at war. The heroes of "Kalevala" often find themselves in battles with witches, demons and other supernatural beings, using their strength, courage and wisdom to overcome these obstacles.
In general, the world of Kalevala is a rich and complex canvas of mythology, nature and culture.

***Kalevala*** is the land of people, the land of heroes.
Kalevala is a fertile and prosperous land rich in forests, lakes and rivers. It is also portrayed as a place of great cultural significance, where traditions of singing and poetry flourish. The people of Kalevala are proud of their heritage and their ability to create powerful songs and spells that they use to solve problems, celebrate important events and honor their ancestors.

***Pohjola*** is the land of cold and darkness in the North, ruled by the witch Louhi.
It is a place of hardship where people must fight to survive in harsh conditions. Despite this, Pohjola is also a land of great wealth and magic, and it is from there that the witch Louhi controls most of the northern world.

***Manala*** refers to the underworld or the land of the dead. It is the place where the souls of the dead go after death and is ruled by Tuoni, the god of death.
