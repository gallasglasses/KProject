### I. Description of the game world

The world of Kalevala is a mythical and magical place inhabited by gods, heroes, witches and other supernatural beings and where the forces of good and evil are constantly at war.
The landscape of Kalevala is vast and varied, including forests, lakes, rivers, mountains and the sea. It is a world shaped by the forces of nature, where the spirits of the natural world are seen as powerful and sometimes dangerous beings. The characters in Kalevala are closely connected to the earth and the natural elements and often use their knowledge of the natural world to overcome difficulties and solve problems.
The world of Kalevala is also a place of great conflict, where the forces of good and evil are constantly at war. The heroes of "Kalevala" often find themselves in battles with witches, demons and other supernatural beings, using their strength, courage and wisdom to overcome these obstacles.
In general, the world of Kalevala is a rich and complex canvas of mythology, nature and culture.

***Pohjola*** is the land of cold and darkness in the North, ruled by the witch Louhi.
It is a place of hardship where people must fight to survive in harsh conditions. Despite this, Pohjola is also a land of great wealth and magic, and it is from there that the witch Louhi controls most of the northern world.

***Manala*** refers to the underworld or the land of the dead. It is the place where the souls of the dead go after death and is ruled by Tuoni, the god of death.

### II. Detailed description of the character.

The main character is an ordinary guy who is given knowledge to the forces of nature and needs to defeat evil.
He should grow in experience as the game progresses, and gain new abilities related to nature.
The main equipment is a sword or staff, kantele, for casting spells that invoke the power of nature. The clothes are simple, peasant. The ability to put on some small items that somehow affect the abilities of the main character. For example, a leather belt, birch bark sandals, a birch amulet, a bag with Karelian pasties.

### III. Gameplay.

The game is planned with chapters, as a parallel with the Kalevala mythology, namely Runes (Songs). Each chapter changes the mood of the game

Falls from heights, Grab and Throw like in Control game, the Guiding Wind like in Ghost of Tsushima, Skill trees.

Bosses:
Giant - Throws natural objects, causes a strong wind or earthquake (like Earthshatter Reinhardt's Ultimate in Overwatch), which slows down the main character
Sorceress - like the concept of Hel-Revenant in God of War: disappearing, teleporting, casting haunting spells
Sea Beast - Tries to destroy your ship (like in Resident Evil 4)
